# SMV2 initial release v1.0r1

* SMV2 is based on [SMV](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV)
* This release is immediately after [SMV release v2.4r1](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV/releases/tag/v2.4r1)

* Removed any dependency to scala/java side of code. No compile needed before using
* Reduced functions, DF and Column helper functions to minimal since current pyspark can do all those natively
* Removed EDD - great stuff, but never used in projects
